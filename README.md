# Natural_Language_Processing_Tasks

# Here I will build up a portfolio of NLP projects, these will be completed during lunch hours Mon-Thur. I will aim to complete one project per week / one per two weeks depending on complexity. In the first instance the aim will be to build MVP's. After 10 projects I will revist a selection of projects to iterate and improve them. This will increase my knowledge and experience within the field of NLP. 



# A logical file structure will be important - tasks will be classified into ML > Supervised vs Unsupervised > etc

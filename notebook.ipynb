Searching for gold inside HTML files\n<p>It used to take days for financial news to spread via radio, newspapers, and word of mouth. Now, in the age of the internet, it takes seconds. Did you know news articles are <em>automatically</em> being generated from figures and earnings call streams? Hedge funds and independent traders are using data science to process this wealth of information in the quest for profit.</p>\n<p>In this notebook, we will generate investing insight by applying <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis\">sentiment analysis</a> on financial news headlines from <a href=\"https://finviz.com\">FINVIZ.com</a>. Using this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing\">natural language processing</a> technique, we can understand the emotion behind the headlines and predict whether the market <em>feels</em> good or bad about a stock. It would then be possible to make educated guesses on how certain stocks will perform and trade accordingly. (And hopefully, make money!)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_611/img/fb_headlines.png\" alt=\"Facebook headlines from FINVIZ.com\"></p>\n<p>Why headlines? And why from FINVIZ?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Headlines, which have similar length, are easier to parse and group than full articles, which vary in length.</li>\n<li>FINVIZ has a list of trusted websites, and headlines from these sites tend to be more consistent in their jargon than those from independent bloggers. Consistent textual patterns will improve the sentiment analysis.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping\">web scraping</a> requires data science ethics (sending a lot of traffic to a FINVIZ's servers isn't very nice), the HTML files for Facebook and Tesla at various points in time have been downloaded.
